# **Sort 012 without any algorithm**

Here, the problem is to sort a given array consisting the numbers only 0s,1s and 2s.<br>
This is the famous problem named as the "*Dutch National Flag*" Problem or Algorithm.<br>


*The problem was proposed by Edsger Dijkstra.* <br>


Problem Statement: 

```tex
Given N balls of colour red, white or blue arranged in a line in random order. You have to arrange all the balls such that the balls with the same colours are adjacent with the order of the balls, with the order of the colours being red, white and blue (i.e., all red coloured balls come first then the white coloured balls and then the blue coloured balls)
```
**Example 1:** 

**Input:** {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2} <br>
**Output:** {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2} <br>

**Example 2:** 

**Input:** {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1} <br>
**Output:** {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}<br>


**Algorithm/PseudoCode :**
* The problem was posed with three colors, here `0′, `1′ and `2′. The array is divided into four sections: 
    * arr[1] to arr[low – 1]
    * arr[low] to arr[mid – 1]
    * arr[mid] to arr[high – 1]
    * arr[high] to arr[n]
* If the ith element is 0 then swap the element to the low range.
* Similarly, if the element is 1 then keep it as it is.
* If the element is 2 then swap it with an element in high range.
